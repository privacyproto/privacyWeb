    <h1>EyeState Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: January 24, 2026</p>

    <p>We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes how EyeState (“the App”) handles data when you use the app.</p>

    <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>The App does not upload your test results or any personally identifiable information to our servers.</strong> All results from visual, color, and reaction tests are processed and stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data.</p>
    <p>To improve the app, we may use analytics services that collect anonymous information (such as app version and platform). This information is not linked to your test results or identity.</p>

    <h2>2. How Data Is Used Within the App</h2>
    <p>Test results are stored on your device and used to display your results and history in the app. If you use subscription-related features, some data may sync across your devices via Apple iCloud. This sync is provided by Apple; we do not have access to data stored in iCloud.</p>
    <p>We do not use your test data for advertising or share it with third parties for marketing.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>Test results are not transmitted to our servers. Please keep your device and Apple account secure to protect your local and iCloud data.</p>

    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You may delete data on your device at any time by uninstalling the app or clearing its data. If you use iCloud sync, you can manage iCloud data in your system settings.</p>

    <h2>5. Subscription Terms</h2>
    <p>The App offers optional membership subscriptions (monthly or annual). Payment and renewal are processed by Apple.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Payment will be charged to your Apple ID account at confirmation of purchase.</li>
        <li>Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>You can manage and cancel subscriptions in Settings &gt; [Your Name] &gt; Subscriptions.</li>
        <li>After cancellation, you retain access to subscription features until the end of the current period.</li>
        <li>Refund requests are handled through Apple’s purchase and subscription support process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy or subscriptions, please contact us at:<br>tellme068@outlook.com</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The updated version will be posted on this page. Please check back periodically.</p>

    <div class="disclaimer">
        <strong>Disclaimer:</strong> EyeState does not collect your personal or health-related test content. Data generated in the app is processed only on your device or, when you use subscription features, synced across your own devices via iCloud. The App is for reference and entertainment only and does not provide medical advice or diagnosis.
