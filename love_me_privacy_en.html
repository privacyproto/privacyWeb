<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>
Welcome to “IsleSpace” (the “App”).
We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information
in a transparent and secure manner.
</p>

<h3>1. Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>
This App does not actively collect, store, or analyze any information that can be used
to personally identify you.
</p>

<p>
All content you create within the App (such as text, images, or records)
is stored only on your device or in the iCloud storage associated with your Apple ID,
and is used solely for data synchronization, backup, and cross-device access.
</p>

<p>
Payments for in-app purchases and subscriptions are processed entirely by Apple
through the App Store. The App does not collect, store, or have access to your
payment details or billing information.
</p>

<p>
Any data generated as a result of using system services such as the App Store or iCloud
is handled by Apple in accordance with Apple’s own privacy policy.
</p>

<h3>2. iCloud and CloudKit Sync</h3>

<p>
This App uses Apple’s iCloud / CloudKit services to provide data synchronization,
backup, and sharing features.
</p>

<p>
All data storage, transmission, and access are handled by Apple’s iCloud infrastructure.
The App does not have access to your Apple ID credentials or authentication information.
</p>

<h3>3. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h3>

<p>
Unless you explicitly choose to share content with others using in-app sharing features,
your data is not accessible to any third parties.
</p>

<p>
The App does not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise disclose your data to any third party.
</p>

<h3>4. Data Security</h3>

<p>
We rely on Apple’s system-level security mechanisms to protect your data,
including encryption, secure transmission, and access controls.
</p>

<p>
While reasonable measures are taken to protect your information,
no electronic storage or transmission method can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
</p>
